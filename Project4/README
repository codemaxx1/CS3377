README
Project 4 has been split into two (2) files: Part1.c and plu.c.

Part1.c
This file is an edited Gaussian Elimination script.
By inputting the number of threads to run, the user simply runs the Part1.c script.  It then does a Gaussian Elimination of some matrix and returns the result.

plu.c
I am going to meet with the TA to understand how to solve this problem.
