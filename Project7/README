Server and Client system.
To use, start the server, and then start the client.  Once a connection has been made, enter the command you want to execute.
 {"lcat","lls","lcd","lpwd","lmkdir","lrm"} will be executed locally (on the client side)
 {"cat","ls","cd","pwd","mkdir","rm"} will be executed on the server.
